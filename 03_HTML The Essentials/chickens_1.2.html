    <p>
        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">fowl</a>, originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a
        term for an adult male bird.
        A younger male may be called a cockerel; a male that has been castrated is a capon.
        The adult female bird is called a hen. "Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature,
        or at least young, bird, but thanks to its usage on restaurant menus has now become
        the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English.
        In older sources common fowl or domestic fowl were typically used for this.

    <h2>General Biology and Habitat</h3>
        <h3>Behavior</h3>

        <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of
            eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking
            order", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or
            roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is
            established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and
            injury.[28] When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in
            a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens
            to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.</p>

        <h4>Crowing</h4>
        <p> A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other
            roosters.[29]
            However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck
            loudly
            after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning calls when they
            sense a
            predator approaching from the air or on the ground.

        <h3>Reproduction</h3>

        <h4> example of h4----Lorem ipsum dolor</h4>

        <p>
            this is a paragraph within h4-- Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,
            Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5]
            but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
            subcontinent.
            From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century
            BCE.[6]
            Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BCE, with the "bird that gives birth every day"
            having
            come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[7][8][9]
