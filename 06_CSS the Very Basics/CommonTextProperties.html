    <h1>Major League Baseball</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
        Major League Baseball (MLB) is an American <a href="nowhere">professional baseball</a> organization and the
        oldest of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. A total of 30 teams play in
        Major League Baseball:
        15 teams in the National League (NL) and 15 in the American League (AL). The NL and AL were formed in 1876 and
        1901, respectively. Beginning in 1903, the two leagues cooperated but remained legally separate entities until
        2000 when they merged into a single organization led by the Commissioner of Baseball.[9][10] The league is
        headquartered in Midtown Manhattan.

        Baseball's first openly all-professional team was the Cincinnati Red Stockings, who were founded in 1869. Before
        that, some teams had secretly paid some players. The first few decades of professional baseball were
        characterized by rivalries between leagues and by players who often jumped from one team or league to another.
        The period before 1920 is known as the dead-ball era, during which players would rarely hit home runs.
        Professional baseball in the United States survived a conspiracy to fix the 1919 World Series, which came to be
        known as the Black Sox Scandal. The sport rose in popularity in the 1920s and survived potential downturns
        during the Great Depression and World War II. Shortly after the war, Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color
        barrier.

        The 1950s and 1960s were a time of club expansion and relocation for the AL and NL. New stadiums and artificial
        turf surfaces began to change the game in the 1970s and 1980s. Home runs dominated the game during the 1990s,
        and media reports began to discuss the use of anabolic steroids among MLB players in the mid-2000s. In 2006, an
        investigation produced the Mitchell Report, which implicated many players in the use of performance-enhancing
        substances, including at least one player from each team.

        Today, MLB is composed of 30 teams: 29 in the United States and 1 in Canada. Teams play 162 games each season
        and five teams in each league advance to a four-round postseason tournament that culminates in the World Series,
        a best-of-seven championship series between the two league champions that dates to 1903. Baseball games are
        broadcast on television, radio, and the Internet throughout North America and in several other countries. MLB
        has the highest total season attendance of any sports league in the world with more than 69.6 million spectators
        in 2018.[11]

        MLB also oversees Minor League Baseball, which comprises lower-tier teams affiliated with the major league
        clubs. MLB and the World Baseball Softball Confederation jointly manage the international World Baseball Classic
        tournament.

        MLB is the second-wealthiest professional sport league by revenue after the National Football League
        (NFL).[12][13][14]

    <h2>Organizational Structure</h2>

    <p>
        MLB is governed by the Major League Baseball Constitution. This document has undergone several incarnations
        since its creation in 1876.[15] Under the direction of the Commissioner of Baseball, MLB hires and maintains the
        sport's umpiring crews, and negotiates marketing, labor, and television contracts. MLB maintains a unique,
        controlling relationship over the sport, including most aspects of Minor League Baseball. This is due in large
        part to the 1922 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Federal Baseball Club v. National League, which held that baseball
        is not interstate commerce and therefore not subject to federal antitrust law. This ruling has been weakened
        only slightly in subsequent years.[16] The weakened ruling granted more stability to the owners of teams and has
        resulted in values increasing at double-digit rates.[16][17] There were several challenges to MLB's primacy in
        the sport, with notable attempts to establish competing leagues occurring during the 1870s, in 1916 with the
        short-lived Federal League, and in 1960 with the aborted Continental League.[16]

        The chief executive of MLB is the commissioner, currently Rob Manfred. The chief operating officer is Tony
        Petitti. There are five other executives: president (business and media), chief communications officer, chief
        legal officer, chief financial officer, and chief baseball officer.[18][19]

        The multimedia branch of MLB, which is based in New York City, is MLB Advanced Media. This branch oversees
        MLB.com and each of the 30 teams' websites. Its charter states that MLB Advanced Media holds editorial
        independence from the league, but it is under the same ownership group and revenue-sharing plan. MLB Productions
        is a similarly structured wing of the league, focusing on video and traditional broadcast media. MLB also owns
        67 percent of MLB Network, with the other 33 percent split between several cable operators and satellite
        provider DirecTV.[20] It operates out of studios in Secaucus, New Jersey, and also has editorial independence
        from the league.[21]

    <h2>Season Structure</h2>

    <h3>Spring Training</h3>

    <p>
        Spring training is a series of practices and exhibition games preceding the start of the regular season.
        Teams hold training camps in the states of Arizona and Florida, where the early warm weather allows teams
        to practice and play without worrying about late winter cold. Spring training allows new players to audition
        for roster and position spots and gives existing team players practice time prior to competitive play.
        The teams that hold spring training in Arizona are grouped into the Cactus League,[129] while teams that
        hold camp in Florida are known as the Grapefruit League.
    </p>

    <h3>Regular Season</h3>

    <p>
        Each team's schedule is typically organized into three-game series, with occasional two- or four-game
        series.[132]
        Postponed games or continuations of suspended games can result in an ad hoc one-game or five-game series. A
        team's
        series are organized into homestands and road trips that group multiple series together. Teams generally play
        games
        five to seven days per week, commonly having Monday or Thursday as an off day. Frequently, games are scheduled
        at night.
        Sunday games are generally played during the afternoon, allowing teams to travel to their next destination prior
        to
        a Monday night game. In addition, teams will play day games frequently on Opening Day, holidays, and getaway
        days.
    </p>

    <h3>Postseason</h3>

    <p>
        When the regular season ends after the first Sunday in October (or the last Sunday in September), ten teams
        enter
        he postseason playoffs. These ten teams consist of six teams that are division champions by earning the best
        regular-season
        overall win-loss record for their respective divisions, and four who are "wild-card" teams that are each one of
        two teams
        in their respective leagues who have earned the best regular season win-loss record but are not division
        champions.
        Four rounds of series of games are played to determine the champion:
