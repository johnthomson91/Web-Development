# Web-Development
Complete Web Development course

Now with over 10 hours of React content.

Massive new React "expansion pack" covers: React basics, JSX, props, state, Vite, MaterialUI, hooks, useEffect, React design patterns, and more.

Hi! Welcome to the brand new version of The Web Developer Bootcamp, Udemy's most popular web development course.  This course was completely overhauled to prepare students for the current job market, now with over 70 hours of total content! This is the only course you need to learn web development. There are a lot of options for online developer training, but this course is without a doubt the most comprehensive and effective on the market.  Here's why:

This is the only Udemy course taught by a professional bootcamp instructor with a track record of success.

92% of my in-person bootcamp students go on to get full-time developer jobs. Most of them are complete beginners when I start working with them.

The previous 2 bootcamp programs that I taught cost $14,000 and $21,000.  This course is just as comprehensive but with latest modern content for a fraction of the price.

Everything I cover is up-to-date and relevant to the current developer job market. This course does not cut any corners. I spent 8 months redoing this behemoth of a course!

We build 13+ projects, including a gigantic production application called YelpCamp. No other course walks you through the creation of such a substantial application.

The course is constantly updated with new content, projects, and modules.  Think of it as a subscription to a never-ending supply of developer training.

You get to meet my cats and chickens!

When you're learning to program you often have to sacrifice learning the exciting and current technologies in favor of the "beginner friendly" classes.  With this course, you get the best of both worlds.  This is a course designed for the complete beginner, yet it covers some of the most exciting and relevant topics in the industry.

Throughout the brand new version of the course we cover tons of tools and technologies including:

HTML5

CSS3

Flexbox

Responsive Design

JavaScript (including modern syntax, ES6, ES2018, etc.)

Asynchronous JavaScript - Promises, async/await, etc.

AJAX and single page apps

Bootstrap 4 and 5

ReactJS

SemanticUI

Bulma CSS Framework

DOM Manipulation

Unix (Command Line) Commands

NodeJS

NPM

ExpressJS

Templating

REST

SQL vs. NoSQL databases

MongoDB

Database Associations

Schema Design

Mongoose

Authentication From Scratch

Cookies & Sessions

Authorization

Common Security Issues - SQL Injection, XSS, etc.

Developer Best Practices

Deploying Apps

Cloud Databases

Image Upload and Storage

Maps and Geocoding

This course is also unique in the way that it is structured and presented. Many online courses are just a long series of "watch as I code" videos.  This course is different. I've incorporated everything I learned in my years of teaching to make this course not only more effective but more engaging. The course includes:

Lectures

Code-Alongs

Projects

Exercises

Research Assignments

Slides

Downloads

Readings
